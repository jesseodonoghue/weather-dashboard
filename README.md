# Interactive Weather Dashboard
With this app, I created an interactive weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap.com API to pull current and future weather data. 

## App Breakdown
The app starts with just a title and search box. When the user enters a city name into the search box, the app fetches the current date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It then places that info at the top of the screen along with an icon representing the current weather conditions. Finally, the 5 day forecast is fetched and placed into individual cards that exist below the main info section. Everything uses the Bootstrap framework and is mobile responsive.
